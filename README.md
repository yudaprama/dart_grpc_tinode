## Requirements

To compile a .proto file, you must use the 'protoc' command which is installed separately. For mac, you can install using homebrew

```bash
brew install protobuf
```

To build standalone `protoc` plugin:

```bash
pub global activate protoc_plugin
```

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Dart
[package](https://flutter.dev/developing-packages/),
a library module containing code that can be shared easily across
multiple Flutter or Dart projects.

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
